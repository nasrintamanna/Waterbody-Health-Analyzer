# Waterbody-Health-Analyzer

Different water bodies around the world such as lakes, rivers, streams, oceans, etc have a poor quality of water because of many factors. Such factors include
pollution, organic chemicals, microbes, etc. Water is life and so it is essential to keep the quality of water to high standards for usage for both fauna and flora.
The water health analyzer program will analyze the water health of different water bodies the users enters by calculating the Secchi Depth(in meters), 
the trophic state index value(using the Secchi depth in meters), and the Hilsenhoff index value of the water body.
Additionally, the trophic state status and the Hilsenhoff index status also have been to be determined by the TSI and Hilsenhoff index values. 
The data values calculated will be stored in a tabular form in a pdf file. A QR code will be generated to store these values as well.
